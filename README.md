## Summary
The website offers an efficient and easy to use way to filter and search for data. However it does have drawbacks that may be addressed.
* The data set is rather limited. The data only includes information from a 13 day period in 2010. Offering data from a larger date set would make the website more beneficial.
* Ater completing a search, the boxes must be manually cleared in order to perform another search. A "Clear" button would make this process more efficient.
* The user has to know the paramenter they are searching for, as there is not a list of options to choose from. A frop down menu for each filter would make this easier and allow the user to see the options.
